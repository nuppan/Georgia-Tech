<h2>Part I: The Internet Protocol Stack</h2>

<strong>A.</strong><em>[14 points]</em> Describe the purpose
of each layer in the internet protocol stack.

<h2>Part II: Basic Networking Concepts</h2>

<strong>A.</strong> <em>[10 points]</em> Assume that packets have a
    header that is 16 bytes long and a payload of 32 bytes. If you wish
    to send a message that is 1024 bytes long, how many packets will
    be required? How many bytes in total will need to be sent?

  <br>
  <br>

<strong>B.</strong> <em>[10 points]</em> Given these parameters:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>wire bandwidth
            <td>15Mbps  (15 x 10^7 bits per second), full-duplex
        <tr>
            <td>time-of-flight
            <td>25ms    (25 x 10^-3 seconds)
        <tr>
            <td>sender overhead
            <td>200us   (200 x 10^-6 seconds)
        <tr>
            <td>receiver overhead
            <td>200us   (200 x 10^-6 seconds)
    </table>
    <br>
    We are sending a 10000-bit message.  What is the observed throughput?  
	Hint: User the equations on Page 690 of Chapter 13 and follow the worked out examples that use these equations.)

<h2>Part III:  Short Answer Questions</h2>

<b>(Part A, 10 Points)</b> 
The transport layer usually handles cases where
packets arrive out of order.  What additional mechanism would our protocol
require in order to handle out-of-order packets?  (Your answer should be
approximately two words long).
<br><br>

<b>(Part B, 5 Points)</b> ntohl() and htonl() are two UNIX C functions.
Briefly describe what they do and why they are needed when sending numbers
over a mixed network.<BR><BR>

<b>(Part C, 5 Points)</b> For each of the following, specify whether
it is big-endian or little-endian:
<ul>
  <li>Linux (x86)
  <li>SPARC
  <li>Windows (x86)
  <li>Java Virtual Machine
  <li>Network Order
</ul>

<h2>Part IV: Networking Hardware</h2>

<b>A.</b><em>[12 points]</em> Describe the function of each
of the following devices and the layer at which they operate:
NIC, Hub, Repeater, Bridge, Switch, Router

<h2>Part V: The MAC layer</h2>

<b>A.</b><em>[12 points]</em> Explain how the Ethernet protocol works<br />
<br />
<b>B.</b><em>[12 points]</em> Explain the difference between CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA.  Why is the
latter used in some circumstances?<br />
<br />
<b>C.</b><em>[10 points]</em>) Define RTS and CTS and explain their use in the MAC layer.
